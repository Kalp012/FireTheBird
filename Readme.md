I am going to make a Fire The Bird application for this capstone final assessments.

I have designed the layout of the app which you can see in the above file.

This app might contains 4 Activity layouts which includes the main Screen, Play window, About, How to play
I will firebase for the backend data storage and database, because firebase is easy to implement and
provides lots of additional functionalities.
